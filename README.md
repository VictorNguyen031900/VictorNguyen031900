### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

# About Me
My name is Victor Nguyen and I'm a 20 year old Computer Information Systems Major at California State University San Marcos.  I strive to become a Software Developer, Database Administrator, or anything involving technology!  I am currently teaching myself a programming language called Python because of its vast usage outside of university.  Alongside learning Python, I'm creating my personal Discord Bot and I plan to have many features to make the bot useful for anyone other than myself.  I'm a full-time student meaning I'm not currently searching for a job but I do want to find an internship involving my major so I can gain more experience!

## Fun Facts!
- I love computer hardware and custom mechanical keyboards
- I'm a dog lover but not opposed to cats either
- My favorite breed of dogs is Pembroke Welsh Corgis and my favorite breed of cats is Scottish Fold
- I love to listen to Joji, Blackpink, and Rich Brian

## Skills

- MIPS Assembly 2019-2019
- Python 2020-Present
